welcome to the beautiful world of raytracing


3d raytracing engine in C 

```
as i venture into the realm of raytracing, the only way out is rendering it as my new reality...
the boundaries between me and my creation blur, blurring the line that i have drawn
the line that was used to discern the echo of the real from the whisper of the rendered
here in the rendered... reality is a fragile word, a tightrope that can lead one into madness...
here in the rendered... the dance of light and shadow continues
```
